HTML    : (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines            themeaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally            used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior              (JavaScript).

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on                other media.
