      This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element
      containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:Ok, so what's the
      relationship between pointers and arrays? Well, in C, the name of an
      array, is actually a pointer to the first element of the array. Confused?
      Let's try to understand this better, and use our "memory address example"
      above again. The memory address of the first element is the same as the
      name of the array:Ok, so what's the relationship between pointers and

    <p>
      We can fix this by adding a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the
      containing element:
    </p>

    <div class="clearfix">
